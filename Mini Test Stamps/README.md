## README: Reverse Number Printing with Rules

**Purpose:**
This Python code generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100, filters out prime numbers, and replaces certain numbers with specific text strings based on divisibility rules. The resulting sequence is printed horizontally.

**Usage:**
1. Save the provided Python code.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python reverse_numbers.py
   ```

**Output:**
The script will print the filtered and replaced numbers in reverse order, separated by spaces.

**Explanation:**
The code consists of the following functions and steps:

1. **`is_prime(num)`:**
   - Checks if a given number is prime using a simple algorithm.
   - Returns `True` if the number is prime, `False` otherwise.

2. **`get_replacement(num)`:**
   - Determines the replacement text for a number based on its divisibility by 3 and 5.
   - Returns "FooBar" if divisible by both 3 and 5, "Foo" if divisible by 3, "Bar" if divisible by 5, or the original number as a string.

3. **Main Execution:**
   - Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100.
   - Filters out prime numbers using the `is_prime` function.
   - Replaces numbers according to divisibility rules using the `get_replacement` function.
   - Reverses the order of the filtered and replaced numbers.
   - Prints the resulting sequence horizontally, separated by spaces.

**Output:**
```
Bar Foo 98 Foo Bar 94 Foo 92 91 FooBar 88 Foo 86 Bar Foo 82 Foo Bar Foo 77 76 FooBar 74 Foo Bar Foo 68 Foo Bar 64 Foo 62 FooBar 58 Foo 56 Bar Foo 52 Foo Bar 49 Foo 46 FooBar 44 Foo Bar Foo 38 Foo Bar 34 Foo 32 FooBar 28 Foo 26 Bar Foo 22 Foo Bar Foo 16 FooBar 14 Foo Bar Foo 8 Foo 4 1
```

This output shows the numbers from 100 to 1, with prime numbers removed and replaced according to the specified rules.
